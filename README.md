# IBM Quantum Challenge Fall 2022

This repository will document lab sessions during the IBM Quantum Challgenge Fall from november 11th to november 18th 2022 - https://challenges.quantum-computing.ibm.com/fall-2022

I am fairly sure that I will not be able to complete all labs on these various applications of quantum computing (Machine Learning, Optimization and Quantum Chemistry) but nevertheless I will upload all labs 1-4 in this repository for practice and educational purposes to me and maybe others too. 

## How to get started
If you are running on your local systems, you may need to install Qiskit Runtime packages which can be dones uing: `pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime`. If you have navigated to the IBM Quantum Lab throught the IBM Quantum Challenge portal, then everything should already be setup for you.

In general you can follow the lab session within the jupyter notebook provided, follow the steps for setup and for task completion.
